# Introduction to SyncedStore

SyncedStore is a library for building distributed, real-time collaborative web applications. This used to be quite complex, but with SyncedStore it's as easy as sharing a pie!

Let's make developing _multiplayer_ (or multi-device) experiences just as simple as developing regular applications.

:::tip Tip: jump straight into the examples
You can walk through the documentation page-by-page, but if you're curious, you might want to jump straight into the live examples:

- [React example](/docs/react)
- [Vue example](/docs/vue)
- [Collaborative text editing](/docs/advanced/richtext)

:::

## Why?

SyncedStore makes it easy to develop applications that:

- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Are collaborative**: create multi-user and multi-device experiences without the need to handle complex conflict resolution management yourself.
- 🚀 **Are fast**: operations are handled locally, and data synchronization with other users and devices happens quietly in the background. 0 Latency!
- 🔗 **Work offline**: cloud apps typically don’t work while offline. Supporting both data sync and offline used to be difficult, not anymore with SyncedStore.

Perhaps most importantly, it makes it easy to build **decentralized applications**. This has a lot of security & privacy benefits compared to always relying on central (expensive) servers to keep track of all our data.

In short, with some technological magic of so-called [CRDTs](https://crdt.tech/) (_Conflict-free Replicated Data Types_), we can build _cross-device_ apps that are _more collaborative_, _faster_, _work offline_ AND put the user _back in control of their data_.

Sounds great? Let's get started!
